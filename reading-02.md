## introducing CSS ch10 p226-245
css associates style rules with html elements using selectors and a declaration. there selector is the html tag that youâ€™re referring to and the declaration is telling it what to do with the information in that tag. you can select more than one tag and give it the same declaration for them to all appear the same. properties are the aspect of the element you want changed like text or color, while the value specifies the setting you want to use, such as the actual color. using inline styling uses css inside of the html tag using a style tag. there are different kinds of selectors and each is referred to differently. the children of elements with styling will inherit the parent style if not otherwise specified.
