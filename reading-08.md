## layout ch 15 p358-404
each html element is a block element or an inline element. if it is a block element it will take up the whole line of the page and what follows will appear below, while an inline block element will take up only the space it needs or is given. an element that contains another element is the direct parent of the contained element. the contained element can be referred to in css by naming the direct parent then the element. you can change the flow and positioning of text in css and adjust the float. adjusting the float will wrap text around an image or element. you can place two float elements next to eachother by designating a height and width of each element. a fixed layout does not change with with the users browser window, while a liquid layout will change to the users settings using percentages. there are css frameworks that can be used to frigid code for common layouts.
